# Python-Selenium
Portfolio of my recent work for a certain company. It contains code that works properly with system behind the scenes but without that context it may be useless. It's main pourpose is to attach it to my resume so it is more like "read-only" version.

This code is first that big program made only by myself. I find it a bit messy but this experiece gave me a lot of ideas how to manage code, comments and visual structure.

It's main idea is to take data in a basic GUI containing 6-7 elements separated by tab (\t), because it allowes a non-programer user copy-paste it from common online file and program reads it properly. This data are required informations of product. The program should find description page (from legal source), scrap it all, put in company's HTML code and insert it to Magento system to proper boxes.

All company's data is hidden.
